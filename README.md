### Welcome!

This page hosts the code for my website!
It's built using React and other basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS elements. I'll put a list of dependencies and stuff here if I ever need it.

## whats the deal?

This is meant to be a playground and a virtual resume of sorts.
I'll put any webpage or interesting thing I make on here for display (including shorts and photography and whatnot).
I'll also attempt to highlight elements of my skills and experience for the sake of marketing myself to employers, etc *(If you're an employer hit me up cause I need a job). 

***NOTE: change when/if hired**

## starting the site

Use `npm start` to open up the development server - run on localhost:3000 by default.

`npm run deploy` will build all the necessary parts to actually deploy the static site to be hosted on github. (I also like to do the regular git commit to save all my code, the npm command doesnt do that part).

## requirements

- React Icons
    - `npm install react-icons --save`
